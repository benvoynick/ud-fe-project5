## Neighborhood Map portfolio project - Ben Voynick

This map will show restaurants in the area of [The Drag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drag_(Austin,_Texas)), a commercial strip along the University of Texas campus in Austin.

The Google Maps API is used to populate a list of restaurants, cafes, bars etc. More information will be loaded from Google Maps and Wikipedia about any locations you select. The additional information loaded is cached to reduce API requests as you continue to use the map.

### Using the map

Open index.html, either in the prod folder or the unoptimized src folder.

Use either the text list or the map markers to look at more information about places of interest. Use the search bar at the top of the list if you know the name of the location you are searching for.
