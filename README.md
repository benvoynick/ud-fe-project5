## Neighborhood Map portfolio project - Ben Voynick

This map will show restaurants in the area of [The Drag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drag_(Austin,_Texas)), a commercial strip along the University of Texas campus in Austin.

The map will search for restaurants, cafes, etc on Google Map and populate an initial. More information will be loaded from Google Maps and Wikipedia about any locations you select.

### Using the map

Open index.html, either in the prod folder or the unoptimized src folder.

Use either the text list or the map markers to look at more information about places of interest. Use the search bar at the top of the list if you know the name of the location you are searching for.
